# Image Retrieval Using Scene Graphs
Justin Johnson et al. “Image Retrieval Using Scene Graphs”. In:The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and PatternRecognition (CVPR). 2015.


### Aim :
Semantic image retrieval using a scene graph

### Scene Graph
Explicitly models :
* objects
* attributes of objects
* relationships b/w objects

### Idea: 
Perform semantic image retrieval using scene graphs asqueries
* Scene graph used to represent the detailed semantics of a scene
* Design Conditional Random Field  model (CRF model of visual scenes) grounding scene graphs to images 
* The likelihoods - used as ranking scores for retrieval
